## Python Lab

This repository is part of my **Developer Labs Series**,  
where I practice algorithms, system fundamentals, and API development hands-on.

---

## Topics Covered
- Algorithms (linear, binary, recursion, sorting)
- API drills using **FastAPI**, **Flask**, and **Django**
- Machine Learning (scikit-learn, TensorFlow)
- Data structures and Big O analysis
- Mini projects for reinforcement and applied practice

---

## Folder Structure
- /algorithms  -> Search & sorting problems
- /api_drills -> Backend routing, CRUD, and authentication practice
- /ai_ml -> Basic ML models and experiments
- /big_o -> Complexity notes & performance testing
- /test -> Unit tests and validation scripts
- /mini projects -> Small projects reinforcing key concepts

---

## Purpose
The goal of this repository is to document my learning journey in Python and strengthen my backend and AI engineering skills through **structured, consistent practice**.

I’m also learning in public, sharing both progress and mistakes so that new and experienced developers alike can see that it’s okay to stumble, experiment, and grow along the way.  
Persistence is the most important skill of all.
